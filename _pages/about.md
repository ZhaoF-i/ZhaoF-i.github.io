About me
======
This is Pengjie Shen’s homepage. I am a **Ph.D. student** in **Computer Science and Technology** at **Inner Mongolia University**, focusing on **speech signal processing**. My research spans several closely related areas:
- **Speech Separation** – designing algorithms that disentangle overlapping speakers in noisy or reverberant environments  
- **Speech Enhancement** – improving intelligibility and perceptual quality for both human listeners and downstream ASR systems  
- **Target Speaker Extraction** – isolating a desired voice from multi‑speaker mixtures using limited enrollment data  
- **Multi‑Channel Microphone Array Processing** – leveraging spatial cues and beamforming strategies to boost robustness under real‑world acoustic conditions
