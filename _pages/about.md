About me
======
This is Zhao Fei’s homepage. I am a **Ph.D. student** in **Computer Science and Technology** at **Inner Mongolia University**, focusing on **speech signal processing**. My research spans several closely related areas:

- **Acoustic Echo Cancellation (AEC)**
- **Active Noise Control (ANC)**
- **Speech Enhancement (SE)**
- **Multi‑Channel Microphone Array Processing**
